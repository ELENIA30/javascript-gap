### install dependencies

before installing any dependencies be sure you are running node version `>= 14.16.0`

`$ npm install`

### run the production build

1. go inside the exercise's branch
    git checkout exercise-1

2. launch node
    node exercise-1/exercise-1.js

### run the test
    npm run test exercise-1/exercise-1.test.js
## Development flow

We have one main branch: `master`. For each exercise I did a branch with the exercise's number

### Dev environment
The feature branch must be named "exercise-"
every branch has three files, exercise-num.js, exercise-num.test.js and a READEME.md file with the description

### thank you!
